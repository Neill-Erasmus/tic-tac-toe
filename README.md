## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a widely recognized game that has stood the test of time. This simple yet engaging contest involves two players taking turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to achieve a winning combination.

Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the game, the Tic-Tac-Toe Game application provides a delightful and interactive way to experience this classic pastime. With features like automatic board resets after a draw and input validation to ensure fair play, the game ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience for players of all ages.

## How to Play

1. Run the application by executing ```python main.py``` in your terminal.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to take turns choosing a row and column to make your move.
3. The game will display the current state of the board after each move.
4. The first player to have three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
